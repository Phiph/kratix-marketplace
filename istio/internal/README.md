# Development

## Build promise.yaml
The `promise.yaml` is generated by interpolating the contents of `resources/` into
the `workerClusterResources`. To build run:

```
./scripts/inject-wcr
```


## Testing
To test the promise install kratix, and then:
```
kubectl apply -f promise.yaml
./scripts/test promise
```

This asserts the Promise is installed correctly.
